# Isospectral Transformations

An isospectral transformation compresses a matrix to a lower dimension while preserving its eigenvalues, with useful applications in network and graph theory. This code is a direct implementation of the procedure invented by [Bunimovich and Webb](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3272).
